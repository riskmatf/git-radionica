Artificial Intelligence usually beats natural stupidity.
Failure is not an option -- it comes bundled with Windows.
Curly brackets are like ears: it doesn`t matter how far they stick out, it`s what you`ve got between them that counts.
If you don’t want to be replaced by a computer, don’t act like one.


POZDRAV RIIIISK :D
